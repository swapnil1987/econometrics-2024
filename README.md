# Topics in Econometrics: Microeconometrics Module


This microeconometrics course provides a comprehensive introduction to the methods and models used to analyze observational and experimental data in economics. It is designed to equip students with the quantitative tools necessary to conduct empirical research and critically evaluate causal claims in economic analyses. Through the course, students will gain proficiency in a wide array of econometric techniques, each critical for addressing different challenges in empirical research.

1. **Potential Outcomes**: The course begins with the framework of potential outcomes, which underpins the modern approach to causal inference. This model provides the foundation for understanding how different econometric methods estimate causal effects.

2. **Endogeneity**: Students will explore the concept of endogeneity—an issue where explanatory variables are correlated with the error term in a regression model—its sources, and its implications for causal inference. Understanding endogeneity is crucial for selecting appropriate econometric methods that yield unbiased estimates.

3. **Randomized Control Trials (RCTs)**: Considered the gold standard for causal inference, RCTs allow for clear-cut interpretations of causal effects. The course examines how RCTs are designed and implemented, and how they help overcome the problem of endogeneity.

4. **Regression Analysis**: This section covers basic and advanced regression techniques, focusing on their assumptions, implementations, and the interpretation of their results. Regression is a fundamental tool in econometrics for analyzing relationships between variables.

5. **Matching**: Students learn about matching techniques as a method to control for confounding variables in observational studies, enabling closer approximations to what would be observed in a randomized experiment.

6. **Instrumental Variables (IV)**: The course introduces IV estimation, a critical technique for dealing with endogenous regressors. This part of the course covers the identification of suitable instruments and the application of two-stage least squares (2SLS).

7. **Difference in Differences (DiD)**: DiD is discussed as a method for evaluating the effect of a treatment or intervention by comparing the changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group and a control group.
