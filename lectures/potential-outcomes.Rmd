# Introduction

- We are interested in causality
    - Does vaccine prevents polio, Covid-19, malaria?
    - Does schooling increases earning potential of individuals?
    - Is dense urban development conducive for economic growth?
    - Why female labor force participation increased in the $20^{th}$ century?
    - ...

- **Objective** of today's lecture
    - Learn about potential outcomes: notation and intuition
    
- **Why?**
    - Fundamental block to talk about causality

# An example

- **Question:** Does health insurance access improves health outcomes

- **Notation:**
    - $Y$ - called _outcome_ - denotes health of individual
    - $D$ - called _treatment_ - denotes whether individual has health insurance or not
    
- Transformation of our question:
    - $D$ has an effect on $Y$?
    
- Why this question is hard?

# An example
<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="figures/red-blue.png" width="60%" height="60%" style="margin: 0 auto;"/>
  <figcaption>Red pill or blue pill</figcaption>
</figure>

# Potential Outcomes

- We do not observe both worlds simultaneously
- But thinking about them helps to understand causality
- **Potential Outcomes**
    - different states that can occur for a unit 
- in our example _unit_ is _individual_
- different states
  - individual's health without health insurance
  - individual's heatlh with health insurance

# Potential Outcomes: Notation

- Neyman-Rubin Causal model

- $n$ individuals 
- index $i$
- Two potential outcomes for each individual
  - health when have health insurance: $Y_i(D_i=1)$ or $Y_i(1)$
  - health when don't have health insurance: $Y_i(D_i=0)$ or $Y_i(0)$
- **SUTVA** Assumption
  - Stable unit treatment value assignment
  - fancy name to say there are no spillover effects
  - individual $i$'s outcome is not affected by treatment of other units
  
---

# Potential outcomes and actual outcome

- For individual $i$ we observe $Y_i$
- Two potential outcomes for the same individual: $Y_i(0), Y_i(1)$
- We can write
  
  \begin{align}
    Y_i = (1-D_i)Y_i(0) +  D_i Y_i(1)
  \end{align}
  where $D_i \in \{0,1\}$
 
| i   | $Y_{i}(1)$ | $Y_{i}(0)$ | $D_{i}$ | $Y_{i}$ |
| --- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1   | 0          | 1          | 1       | 0       |
| 2   | 0          | 0          | 1       | 0       |
| 3   | 1          | 0          | 0       | 0       |
|  $\vdots$    |         $\vdots$    | $\vdots$   |    $\vdots$      |       $\vdots$   |
| n   | 0          | 1          | 0       | 1       |

# Reiterating the objective

- We want to estimate the causal effect of treatment $D$
- Life would be easy if observe both potential outcomes
- But, life is not easy
- Essentially, our whole objective will be to construct that missing potential outcome
    - counterfactual
- Essence of this module: construction of counterfactuals
